<p><em>Functionality from Structure</em></p><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The sixth workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional Programming
is devoted to the derivation of functionality from structure. It is a
celebration of the direct impact of Theoretical Computer Science on
programs as we write them today. Modern programming languages, and in
particular functional languages, support the direct expression of
mathematical structures, equipping programmers with tools of
remarkable power and abstraction. Where would Haskell be without
monads? Functional reactive programming without arrows?
Call-by-push-value without adjunctions? The list goes on. This
workshop is a forum for researchers who seek to reflect mathematical
phenomena in data and control.</p><h2>Proceedings</h2>

<p>The proceedings have now been published as

<p>MSFP 2016 was held on Friday 8th April. This time around, we're
delighted to be affiliated with <a href="http://www.etaps.org/">ETAPS 2016</a>,
running 2nd-8th April in Eindhoven, The Netherlands.</p><h2>Invited Speaker: Fredrik Nordvall-Forsberg</h2>

<p>We are delighted to have
<a href="https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/fredrik.nordvall-forsberg/">Fredrik Nordvall-Forsberg</a>
as our invited speaker this year. The title and abstract of Fred's
talk are:</p><p><strong>Higher inductive types in Homotopy Type Theory: applications and theory</strong></p><blockquote><p> Homotopy Type Theory is an foundational system and programming
 language that connects ideas from type theory and homotopy theory:
 we think of types as spaces, terms as points in a space, and of
 Martin-Löf's identity type as the path space of a given space.  This
 led Lumsdaine and Shulman to consider a generalisation of inductive
 types, where not only points are freely generated, but also paths,
 paths between paths, and so on. Inductive types with such
 higher-dimensional generators are called Higher Inductive Types
 (HITs).  HITs generalise ordinary inductive types, as well as
 quotient types, but also geometrical objects such as intervals,
 spheres or tori can be represented using HITs, leading the way to
 synthetic homotopy theory.</p><p> In this talk, I will give a gentle introduction to HITs. I will
 survey some of their applications, such as doing homotopy theory
 inside Homotopy Type Theory. I will then talk about the surprisingly
 relatively undeveloped theory underlying HITs.  While we know many
 particular examples of HITs, we do not yet have a general schema for
 well-behaved definitions. Moreover, even for simple,
 "well-understood" HITs, we do not have proof-theoretical results
 such as normalisation or confluence. Trying to rectify this is joint
 work with Thorsten Altenkirch, Paolo Capriotti and Gabe Dijkstra.</p></blockquote>
