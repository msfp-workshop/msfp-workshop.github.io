<h1>Workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional Programming (MSFP)</h1>

<p><em>Functionality from Structure</em></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The workshop series on Mathematically Structured Functional
Programming is devoted to the derivation of functionality from
structure. It is a celebration of the direct impact of Theoretical
Computer Science on programs as we write them today. Modern
programming languages, and in particular functional languages, support
the direct expression of mathematical structures, equipping
programmers with tools of remarkable power and abstraction. Where
would Haskell be without monads? Functional reactive programming
without arrows?  Call-by-push-value without adjunctions? The list goes
on. This workshop is a forum for researchers who seek to reflect
mathematical phenomena in data and control.</p>
