<h1>Eighth Workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional Programming (MSFP 2020)</h1>

<p><em>Functionality from Structure</em></p>

<h3><em>Due to the global coronavirus pandemic, ETAPS 2020 and
associated in-person events have been cancelled. MSFP 2020 will now be
held as a virtual meeting.</em></h3>

<h3><em>Registration deadline: Tuesday 25th August</em></h3>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The eighth workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional
Programming is devoted to the derivation of functionality from
structure. It is a celebration of the direct impact of Theoretical
Computer Science on programs as we write them today. Modern
programming languages, and in particular functional languages, support
the direct expression of mathematical structures, equipping
programmers with tools of remarkable power and abstraction. Where
would Haskell be without monads? Functional reactive programming
without arrows?  Call-by-push-value without adjunctions? The list goes
on. This workshop is a forum for researchers who seek to reflect
mathematical phenomena in data and control.</p>

<p><del>MSFP 2020 will be held on Saturday 25th April 2020 in affiliation with <a href="https://www.etaps.org/2020">ETAPS
2020</a> in Dublin, Ireland.</del></p>

<p>MSFP 2020 will be held on <em>Monday 31st August and Tuesday 1st
September 2020</em> online.</p>
