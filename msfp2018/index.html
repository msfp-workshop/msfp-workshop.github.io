<p><em>Functionality from Structure</em></p><h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The seventh workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional
Programming is devoted to the derivation of functionality from
structure. It is a celebration of the direct impact of Theoretical
Computer Science on programs as we write them today. Modern
programming languages, and in particular functional languages, support
the direct expression of mathematical structures, equipping
programmers with tools of remarkable power and abstraction. Where
would Haskell be without monads? Functional reactive programming
without arrows?  Call-by-push-value without adjunctions? The list goes
on. This workshop is a forum for researchers who seek to reflect
mathematical phenomena in data and control.</p><h2>Proceedings</h2>

Atkey</a> and <a href="mailto:sam.lindley@ed.ac.uk">Sam
Lindley</a> if you have any questions about
the scope of the workshop.</p><p><strong>New this time</strong> We accept two categories of submission: full papers
of no more than 15 pages that will appear in the proceedings, and
extended abstracts of no more than 2 pages which we will post on the
website, but which do not constitute formal publications and will not
appear in the proceedings. References and appendices are not included
in page limits. Appendices may not be read by reviewers. </p><p>Full papers (not two page talk abstracts) must report previously
unpublished work and not be submitted concurrently to another
conference with refereed proceedings. Accepted papers and talks must
be presented at the workshop by at least one of the authors.</p><p>The proceedings will be published under the auspices of

must be prepared in LaTeX using the <a href="http://style.eptcs.org/">EPTCS macro
package</a>. </p><p>We are using EasyChair to manage submissions. To submit a paper, use
