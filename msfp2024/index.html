<h1>Tenth Workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional Programming (MSFP 2024)</h1>

<p><em>Functionality from Structure</em></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The tenth workshop on Mathematically Structured Functional
Programming is devoted to the derivation of functionality from
structure. It is a celebration of the direct impact of Theoretical
Computer Science on programs as we write them today. Modern
programming languages, and in particular functional languages, support
the direct expression of mathematical structures, equipping
programmers with tools of remarkable power and abstraction. Where
would Haskell be without monads? Functional reactive programming
without arrows? Call-by-push-value without adjunctions? The list goes
on. This workshop is a forum for researchers who seek to reflect
mathematical phenomena in data and control.</p>

<p>MSFP 2024 will be held on Monday 8th July 2024 in affiliation with <a href="https://compose.ioc.ee/icalp2024/">ICALP/LICS/FSCD 2024</a> in Tallinn, Estonia.</p>

<h2>Proceedings</h2>

<p>The proceedings will be published in EPTCS, as in recent years.</p>

<h2>Invited Speaker</h2>

<p><a href="https://nathancorbyn.com//">Nathan Corbyn</a>, University of Oxford, UK, <b>title TBA</b></p>

<h2>Call for Papers</h2>

<p>Submissions are welcomed on, but not restricted to, topics such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>structured effectful computation</li>
  <li>structured recursion</li>
  <li>structured corecursion</li>
  <li>structured tree and graph operations</li>
  <li>structured syntax with variable binding</li>
  <li>structured datatype-genericity</li>
  <li>structured search</li>
  <li>structured representations of functions</li>
  <li>structured quantum computation</li>
  <li>structure directed optimizations</li>
  <li>structured types</li>

</ul>

<p> Please contact the programme chairs <a href="mailto:kbh@umn.edu">Favonia</a> and <a href="mailto:jeremy.gibbons@cs.ox.ac.uk">Jeremy Gibbons</a> if you have any questions about the scope of the workshop. </p>

<p>
We accept two categories of submission:
<ul>
<li><em>Full papers of at most fifteen (15) pages that will appear in the proceedings.</em> The proceedings will be published under the auspices of <a href="eptcs.org">EPTCS</a> with a Creative Commons license, and thus, full papers must be prepared in LaTeX using the <a href="http://style.eptcs.org/">EPTCS macro package</a>. Concurrent submissions to other conferences, workshops, journals, or similar venues are prohibited. Resubmissions of already formally published works are also prohibited.</li>
<li><em>Extended abstracts of at most two (2) pages, which we will post on the website but do not constitute formal publications</em> and will not appear in the proceedings. This means you can submit an extended abstract based on a previously published work, or publish a paper later based on the extended abstract in another venue. You do not have to use the EPTCS macro package for extended abstracts.</li>
</ul>
<p>A short abstract should be submitted by four days in advance of the paper deadline (for both full paper and extended abstract submissions). References and appendices are not included in page limits, but reviewers may or may not read appendices. Accepted papers and talks must be presented at the workshop by at least one of the authors.</p>

<p>We are using <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=msfp2024">EasyChair</a> to manage submissions.</p>
